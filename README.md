## Simple shell that behaves like bash and contains these commands built-in :

◦ echo with option ’-n’.  
◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path.  
◦ pwd without any options.  
◦ export without any options.  
◦ unset without any options.  
◦ env without any options and any arguments.  
◦ exit without any options.  

## and works with these delimiters :

• ; in the command separates commands like in bash.  
• ' and " work like in bash except for multiline commands.  
• Redirections < > “>>” work like in bash except for file descriptor aggregation.  
• Pipes | work like in bash.  
• Backslash \ work like in bash.  
• Environment variables ($ followed by characters) work like in bash.  
• $? work like in bash.  
• ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ have the same result as in bash.
